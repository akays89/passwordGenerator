# Password Generator
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
## Description
I created this application to generate a random password based on criteria chosen bye the user. This application was developed using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. This would be a great tool to create a secure password to protect your sensitive data both at home and work. Also by giving options on what kind of characters you would like to use this will cater to any websites password requirements. In the future I would like to try and add a clipboard button so that the user can easily copy the password and paste it where they need it.
